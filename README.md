# Welcome to Beer-Browser-MG Repo

This Repository is for the simple beer sear application, Beans Love Beer.
This application allows you to browse a variety of beer options, you can search by style of beer or a beer name if you'd like.  Otherwise, if you're unsure, you can always test your luck with simply clicking the search button and a random beer will be selected for you!

## Planning and Story: Development Process and Problem-Solving Strategy:

### Planning:
- I drew out a wireframe based on the image provided.
- I then used the React Auth template to create a starting session for this application.
- The first step of the development process was writing the API calls to comunicate with the beerAPI
- Then I built a couple class components that would allow the user to navigate through the application.

### Problem-Solving:
- The next problem I am trying to resolve is allowing the user to click on the star in the corner of the card and like their favorite beers.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to browse beer selections from the index
- As a user, I want to be able to click on a beer and see more options
- As a user, I want to search for a style of beer
- As a user, I want to find one specific beer
- As a user, I want to be able to find a random beer if I don't know what to look for

## Technologies Used:
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- React
- Axios

## Unsolved Problems:
- 'Like' star button so users can 'like' their favorites
